# HASHGRAM - Fake Meets Check

## Project Goal:
The goal is to verify the authenticity of user-generated content using Multi-Modal AI detection (images, videos) and to aware online users malicious manipulation or plagiarism

### To run the code - 
- clone the repository to your system
- redirect your command line tool/terminal to the firebase-login folder
- enter 'npm start' in the command line tool/terminal
- once you reach the HashGram website sign up as a new user with your email address, user name and your preferred password
- once you are in, CONGRATULATIONS! you will be able to use our social media clone as a simulation to experience how our model detects deepfake videos or copied/edited video clips (+ giving you the link to the original video) that come on your feed!
- Coming to the main utility (create a post) page, you can choose to upload a form of media, and HashGram will undergo SHA-256 Hashing, deepfake detection, and then ultimately deep learning (ResNet50) to detect deepfake/unoriginal content. In the case of images also, you can check whether its original or not.
- But do you users know the best part? ALL OF THIS HAPPENS IN AN INSTANT: Our software gives you the labels in the form of frames of colors: yellow and red, to see whether its a fake, r
