# HASHGRAM - Fake Meets Check

## Project Goal:
The goal is to verify the authenticity of user-generated content using Multi-Modal AI detection (images, videos) and to aware online users malicious manipulation or plagiarism

### To run the code - 
- clone the repository to your system
- redirect your command line tool/terminal to the firebase-login folder
- enter 'npm start' in the command line tool/terminal
- once you reach the HashGram website
- sign up as a new user with your email address and user name with your preferred password
- once you are in, CONGRATULATION! you will be able to use our social media as a simulation of how to detect deepfake images or videos or even get to know whther an arbitrary user has edited your video and has reposted this!!
- Now, giving opportunnity to view everyones posts is one thing, but how about you check whether you are authentically uplaoding a rightful post?
- Coming to the main utility page, you can choose to upload a form of media, and HashGram will undergo SHA-256 Hashing, deepfake detection, and then ultimately deep learning(ResNet50), in the case of videos.
- In the case of images, DONT WORRY!, you can check whether its edited or not with just a click.
- But do you users know the best part? ALL OF THIS HAPPENS IN AN INSTANT.
- Giving you the labels in the form of frames of colors: yellow and red, to see whether its a fake, r
- Bringing a real time interface, supported by a self-made, and self-compiled AI model to
